##Overview of the project

###Project:implementing and comparing different AI models using appropriate evaluation metrics

###Objective
The main objective of this project is implementing and comparing different AI models using
appropriate evaluation metrics

###key activites
- **I had created the python code first and tested in gogglecolab**.
- **Again I changed the test_size and random_state and tested it again.I got different outputs**.
### technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language
- **Numpy**:NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for working with arrays and mathematical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and is the foundation of most scientific computing in Python.
- **Pandas**:Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling structured data, including tabular data such as spreadsheets and SQL tables.
- **Scikit-learn**:Scikit-learn is a library for machine learning. It provides a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and other tasks, along with tools for model selection, data preprocessing, and feature selection.
